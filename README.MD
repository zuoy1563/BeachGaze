# Beachgaze - Spring Boot

This project helps parents who would like to take their children to beaches in Melbourne understand the common beach dangers and provides some useful tips on how to deal with different dangers. Parents are also provided with beach and weather information, safety quizzes and visualised important data.

To build this project, please make sure that you have the basic knowledge on the structure of Spring Boot applications as well as how to use Gradle. Important configurations can be found in src/main/resources/application.properties.

Have fun!
