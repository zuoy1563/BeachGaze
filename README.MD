This is a web application about beach safety. The team members of 
Guardians are all from Monash University and the website is their
final project during their postgraduate. After reading some reports, 
they decided to aim on helping parents with children under 15 and want 
to go beaches with their children. They want to let parents know the 
dos and don'ts while playing around beaches and help them to find a
safest beach for their children.
