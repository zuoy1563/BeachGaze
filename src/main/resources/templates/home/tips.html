        <h2>Historical Accidents Around Beaches</h2>
        <h3>Shark Attack Cases</h3>
        <p>Some parents may concern about shark attacks around beaches. Reports show that there are approximately
            23 people died from shark attacks each year in Australia, but only about 2 cases are in Victoria, which
            means Victorian beaches are relatively safe.</p>
        <p>The following graph shows the trend of shark attacks in both Australia and Victoria from 2010 to
            2018.</p>

                        <p>Rip currents are powerful, channeled currents of water that can pull a swimmer out to sea. They are
                            difficult to spot but some signs include smooth water located between breaking waves, anything floating
                            out to sea or sandy, foamy water floating out beyond the waves. The best way to avoid a rip is to swim
                            at a patrolled beach between the red and yellow flags. <br/>
                            if caught by a rip current, do not attempt to fight it. Instead, try to swim parallel to the shore and
                            then on an angle when the effects of the rips lessen.</p>

                        <p>A shore-break is when waves break directly on the shore. These are considerably dangerous as
                            they can pull unsuspecting swimmers off their feet and into deeper water or into the
                            sand on the ocean floor. Even small shore-breaks can be quite dangerous. If thrown by one, keep your hands in
                            front of you at all times to protect your head and neck.<br/>
                            Remember to always swim between the flags and ask a lifeguard if unsure of the wave conditions.</p>

                        <p>Australia is home to various species of jellyfish. Luckily for Victorian beachgoers, the majority of more
                            dangerous jellyfish prefer the warmer waters of northern Australia. However, there are still some
                            jellyfish that are common in Melbourne beach waters. The bluebottle jellyfish is perhaps the most well
                            known and most common jellyfish found in Melbourne waters. This jellyfish is poisonous but not typically
                            deadly. Another common type is the lionâ€™s mane jellyfish which is also poisonous but not deadly.</p>

                            The water quality is assessed weekly by the local council and steps will be taken to close a beach if the water

                            going to the beach, especially if planning to go after a day of heavy rainfall.</p>

                            Though they are a danger, often a beach will be closed if there is a risk of harmful algal blooms affecting
