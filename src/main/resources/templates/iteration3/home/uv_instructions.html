            <blockquote class="blockquote">
                <p class="mb-0">Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is part of the electromagnetic spectrum emitted by the sun.
                    Whereas UVC rays (wavelengths of 100-280 nm) are absorbed by the atmospheric ozone, most radiation
                    in the UVA range (315-400 nm) and about 10 % of the UVB rays (280-315 nm) reach the Earthâ€™s surface.
                    Both UVA and UVB are of major importance to human health.
                    <br/>
                    Small amounts of UV are essential for the production of vitamin D in people, yet overexposure may
                    result in acute and chronic health effects on the skin, eye and immune system.</p>
                <footer class="blockquote-footer">From<cite title="Source Title">World Health Organisation</cite></footer>
            </blockquote>
            <b>Note</b>: UV radiation also exists even if it is cloudy or even rainy. In addition, UV rays could cause sunburn,
            and sunburn could cause 95% of a fatal skin cancer called Melanoma. So, do check the current UV and protect
            yourself properly. Click <a href="/statistics">here</a> to read more about statistics on Melanoma.

            <ul>The UV index scale consists of five levels according to United States Environmental Protection Agency:
                <li><span style="color: #5cb85c">0-2 (Low)</span>: low danger from sun's UV rays for the average person.</li>
                <li><span style="color: #cac70b">3-5 (Moderate)</span>: moderate risk of harm from unprotected sun exposure.</li>
                <li><span style="color: #f88c3a">6-7 (High)</span>: high risk of harm from unprotected sun exposure. Protection against skin and eye damage is needed.</li>
                <li><span style="color: #d9534f">8-10 (Very High)</span>: very high risk of harm from unprotected sun exposure. Take extra precautions because unprotected skin and eyes will be damaged and can burn quickly.</li>
                <li><span style="color: #8b5097">11 or more (Extreme)</span>:  extreme risk of harm from unprotected sun exposure. Take all precautions because unprotected skin and eyes can burn in minutes. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Generally speaking, it is not recommended to go outside once the UV is marked as High or more. If you really
            would like to visit beaches at that time, please do apply sunscreens and minimise your time in the sun between 10
            a.m and 4 p.m.</p>

            <!--Tips-->
            <h1>Some Tips to Help Protect You and Your Children</h1>
            <h2>Wear Sun-protective Clothing if Possible</h2>
            <p>All clothes are sun-protective to some degree. However, they are divided into several levels. For the
            normal short-sleeved shirts or short pants, obviously it can only provide limited protection to your skin,
            while long-sleeved shirts and long pants can help protect your skin much better. Of course, it would be the best
            if you could wear some clothes that are applied with new technology to absorb the UV rays.</p>

            <h2>Wear Hats and Sunglasses if Possible</h2>
            <p>It would also be a good choice if you could wear hats with broad brims, which could significantly help protect
            your eyes and face. Sunglasses could also help protect your eyes. Remember, eyes are every vulnerable to UV
                rays, so do treat your eyes with care.</p>

            <img src="images/uv/uv_1.jpg" alt="Wear Hats" class="center">

            <h2>Apply Sunscreen</h2>
            <p>Sunscreen is a must to protect your skin from UV rays. It is important to understand some concepts before you
            choose your sunscreen. In short, sunscreen labelled with SPF 15 means that it could filter approximately 93% of
            UV rays while SPF 30 means that it could filter approximately 97% of UV rays. SPF 50 sunscreen could filter 98%
            of UV rays. In most of the cases, SPF 30 sunscreen is the best choice for daily use.
            <br/>
            Sunscreen should be applied 20 minutes before exposure to UV rays because it needs some time to take effect.
            The recommended application is 5ml for each arm, leg, body and face. Sunscreen should be re-applied every 2 hours and
                immediately after swimming.
            <br/>
                <img src="images/uv/uv_2.jpg" alt="Sunscreen" class="center">
            There are some special considerations should be taken for your children. First, it would be best if you could
                buy sunscreen that are designed for children to use. Besides, please limit the time that your children could
                be exposed to UV rays since their skin are easier to get burnt.
                <br/>
                <b>Note</b>: Sunscreen could irritate your skin, make sure that you try before using.
